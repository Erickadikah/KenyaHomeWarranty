What Does Kenya Home Warranty Cover(Our Services)?
Cover's major housing systems- for example, plumbing or electrical wiring- for a set period of time. This contract protects homeowners from high repair costs, dealing with fraudulent contractors, and ensures that users' property are taken care of properly. A home warranty covers sudden appliance breakdowns and system failures. These are not covered under an insurance policy. With a home warranty, you will be covered if your refrigerator stops running or your plumbing backs up. That saves you money, time, and emotional stress. Our service contracts promise fast services for covered issues. They protect your home. Our home warranty covers systems and appliances in the home that suffer from wear and tear. The amount of coverage is chosen by you. See our plans.
